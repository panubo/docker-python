# Python Base

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/panubo/docker-python.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/panubo/docker-python)

This builds the latest [Python](http://python.org) versions from source. The base container is CentOS 7.

Useful for development or testing against the latest Python versions, or for use as a basis for a custom Python build.

Not recommended for production as the images are rather large and not particularly optimised.

## Status

Stable.
